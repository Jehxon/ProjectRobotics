% This function detects if the robot went past a magnet between the last
% measure and the current measure.
% It returns the number of magnets that the robot stopped detecting.

% It is required that no magnet detected is coded as -1 in the measure
% vector, that is why we use the addNegativeOnesToMeasurments function.

% If there is at most one magnet detected in the old measure, then we must
% only check the first measure of lastMeasures and we have at most one
% magnet lost. We do that in order not to compare no magnet with no magnet,
% and finding a false match.

        return;

% We compare each measure from lastMeasures to each measures in the current
% measure, if the values match (one unit or less appart) then we remove one
% magnet from the counter, because there is one magnet that is still
% detected.
